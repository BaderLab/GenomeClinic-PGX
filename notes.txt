- Look at Gulp and use browserify;
- Html should be independant of the assest of the application
- split up routes file into independant sections.



public/
	|- only have the output for gulp builds

everything accessible to the browser should be public

routes/ -- list of endpoints
 
run expresss init.

biggest issue private/public


js-hint


-----------------------------------------
app
	|
	|-bin/ 
		|- this houses the main executable, mainly the srever.js

	|-public/   -- holds the publically serverd content
		|- images
		|- css
		|- js
	|-routes/
		|-index
		|-users
	|-view/ -- holds thee templates to use





I need to map out how this will look>

first of all

1> index.js > 
		| - require utility.js
		| - require templates.js
		| - require 
		|
