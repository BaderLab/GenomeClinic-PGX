		"rec" : "The patient is an HLA-B*57:01 allele carrier and  therefore is at a higher risk to develop abacavir induced hypersensitivity reaction. Treatment with an abacavir-containing regimen is not recommended and should be considered only under exceptional circumstances when the potential benefit outweighs the risk. The risk for HLA-B*57:01 carriers to develop significant hypersensitivity reactions  is above 50%. "
